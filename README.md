# face_recognition-attendance-system
i had devloped a realtime face_reccognition attendance system which will fetch the data from the database and compare it if the data matches then it wiill be stored in the csv file. technoligies used is face_recognition,opencv,python.
A face recognition attendance system automates attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. Its key features include:

1.Facial Recognition: Identifies and verifies individuals based on facial features.
2.Real-time Tracking: Records attendance as individuals are recognized.
3.Database Integration: Manages and stores facial data and attendance records.
4.Automated Notifications: Sends alerts when attendance is recorded.
5.User-friendly Interface: Provides easy management and viewing of attendance records.
6.Security: Protects data with encryption and secure access.
7.Reporting: Generates reports on attendance trends and individual records.
8.Scalability: Accommodates varying sizes of organizations.

Working Mechanism:

1.Enrollment: Users provide facial images, which are processed to create unique facial profiles stored in a database.
2.Face Detection: The system captures an image or video stream and detects faces using image processing techniques.
3.Face Recognition: Detected faces are compared to stored profiles. A match identifies the person and marks their attendance.
4.Attendance Marking: Attendance is recorded with a timestamp, and records are updated, triggering notifications if configured.
5.Reporting and Management: Administrators can generate reports and manage records through a user-friendly interface.
Technologies Used:

Python Libraries:

OpenCV: For image processing and video capture.
Dlib: For facial landmark detection.
Face_recognition: Simplifies face recognition tasks.

Encryption Libraries: For data protection.
Authentication Libraries: For user access management.
Hardware:

Cameras: For capturing facial images.
Computing Resources: For running recognition algorithms and managing data.
Combining these elements provides a reliable, efficient, and automated solution for attendance tracking in various settings.
